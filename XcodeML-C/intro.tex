\section{Introduction}


Xcode for the C programming language is intermediate code that can be used to reconstruct a C program. This specification describes the Xcode XML representation.

This intermediate code level has the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Preserves information that can be used to reconstruct a C program,
\item Can represent the type information of the C programming language, 
\item Has syntax elements necessary for a variety of transformations, and
\item Has a human-readable format (XML).
\end{itemize}

C-front is used to convert a C program to an XcodeML file. A decompiler is used to convert from an XcodeML file to a C program. Xcode programs can be created and analyzed using an analysis program.
